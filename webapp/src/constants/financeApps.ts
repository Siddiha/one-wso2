// Registry of the digiops-finance apps and their top-level menu items,
// surfaced inside the Me perspective — claims/expenses are something an
// employee submits and tracks for themself, same rationale as Leave. Every
// item is a native route (built under src/features/finance/*), so each
// carries a `path` — the left rail navigates straight to it.
//
// Transcribed from each app's own webapp nav (routes.tsx / route.ts /
// Sidebar). Finance app roles (USER / EMPLOYEE / LEAD / FINANCE) map onto
// One WSO2 capabilities as: USER/EMPLOYEE/all → everyone, LEAD → lead,
// FINANCE → admin (One WSO2 has no dedicated Finance privilege number).
// Each app's own backend still enforces its real role scheme; these
// capability gates just decide what shows in the rail.
